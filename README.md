# Breeze Catppuccin

![](/assets/demo.png)

## Description

Just like KDE Breeze Dark cursor pack, but with Catppuccin Mocha colors

Note that the cursors design and the scripts from `src/` directory are not mine, I just recolored the original `.svg`s to make it look Catppuccin

## Installation

First of all, make sure you have installed `inkscape` and `xorg-xcursorgen` packages. After that, run the installer script:

```Shell
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desyatkoff/breeze-catppuccin/main/install.sh)
```

Then, go to System Settings -> Appearance & Style -> Colors & Themes -> Cursors -> Breeze Catppuccin -> Apply

And now your cursor looks exactly like Breeze but the colors are matching with your Catppuccin-colored rice/theme :3
